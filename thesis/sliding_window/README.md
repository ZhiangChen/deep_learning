# Sliding Window for Object Detection
*Zhiang Chen, March 2017*

### 1. patch_publisher
It loads the patch parameters from the yaml file generated by orthaffine_projection/select_area_from_file. Then it receives the point cloud from the kinect by topic 'kinect2/qhd/points', crops the point cloud within the patch and publishes them to topic 'tf_patch'. 

### 2. sliding_window.py
It uses sliding window to do the object detection

```
roslaunch kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge
rosrun rviz rviz
rosparam load auto_recognition2.yaml
rosrun sliding_window patch_publisher
rosrun sliding_window sliding_window.py
```

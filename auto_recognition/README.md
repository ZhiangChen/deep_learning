## Description
This is a ros package for 3D objects recognition. 

## Dependencies
- ROS Indigo
- Kinect2 Bridge
- Tensorflow (Python2)
- [pcl_utils](https://github.com/wsnewman/learning_ros/tree/master/Part_3/pcl_utils)

## ROS Nodes
#### 1. kinect2depth (cpp)
Receive the pointcloud data from "kinect2/qhd/points", and then project the points in the box filter to a depth image. Publish the depth image to "depth_image" with 10hz.

#### 2. depth2input (python2)
Receive the depth image from "depth_image", and crop the image by a 34x34 window. Then publish the cropped image to "cropped_depth_image" with 10hz.

#### 3. evaluate_image (python2)
Receive the cropped image from "cropped_depth_image", and reformat its shape to be compatible with the input shape for the network. And then evaluate the input.

## Usage
```shell
roslaunch kinect2_bridge kinect2_bridge.launch
rosrun auto_recognition kinect2depth
rosrun auto_recognition depth2input
rosrun auto_recognition evaluate_image
rosrun image_view image_view image:= cropped_depth_image
rostopic echo prediction
```
